# My neovim configs

Relies on [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

Colorscheme colors/dgrin-fullcolor.vim is (or was) written by me from scratch. If you happen to
like it, you're free to use it with or without credit - it's just colorcodes after all. But please
don't claim, I've stolen it from you :-)

The colorshceme is still very far from being complete. If I ever think dgrin (it was a 256-color
scheme once, hence the fullcolor suffix here) is finished, I'll probably move it to a separate repo.
